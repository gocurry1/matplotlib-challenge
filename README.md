Repository includes pymaceuticals_matplotlib.ipynb which analyzes mouse_metadata.csv and study_results.csv which are both located in the data folder. 



## Observations and Insights

-Ceftamin and Infubinol have the the 2 highest median final tumor volumes of the targetted drug treatments indicating they are less efficent.

-On Capomulin, there is a very clear correlation between increasing mouse weight and increasing average tumor volume.

-As seen on the Tumor Volume vs Timepoint Line graph, drug treatment takes 4 time units to see an effect at which point the tumor volume drops. This cycle repeats where the volume of the tumor increases for another 4 time units until it experiences another drop.
